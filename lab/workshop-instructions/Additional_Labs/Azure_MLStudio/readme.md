# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **20-minute** exercise, you will successfully fine-tune the Phi-3 model using Azure Machine Learning. Please note that the fine-tuning process can take a considerable amount of time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

## Lab Scenario
This lab scenario is a continuation of the previous lab, where you fine-tuned the Phi-3 model using the Hugging Face library. In this lab, you will fine-tune the Phi-3 model using Azure Machine Learning Studio and Azure Model Catalog.

## Lab Outline
This lab consists of the following exercises:
1. Fine-tune and Deploy the Phi-3 model in Azure ML Studio


### Fine-tune and Deploy the Phi-3 model in Azure ML Studio
 

Fine-tune the Phi-3 model
In this exercise, you will fine-tune the Phi-3 model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

In this exercise, you will:

- Create computer cluster for fine-tuning.
- Fine-tune the Phi-3 model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

### Create computer cluster for fine-tuning

- Visit Azure ML Studio.

- Select Compute from the left side tab.

- Select Compute clusters from the navigation menu.

- Select + New.

> [!TIP]
>You can select Advanced settings to customize configurations such as `learning_rate` and `lr_scheduler_type` to optimize the fine-tuning process according to your specific needs.

- Select Finish.

 After running the fine-tuning job, you need to wait for it to complete. You can monitor the status of the fine-tuning job by navigating to the Jobs tab on the left side of your Azure Machine Learning Workspace. In the next series, you will deploy the fine-tuned model and integrate it with Prompt flow.
